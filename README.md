# Sitegeist.ScentMark

Mark and Bark on Neos via CLI. This can help to orchestrate tasks in Cluster Environments where certain tasks like cache flushing or publishing of static resources shall only be
executed on the first container of a newly deployed app version or on only one of many containers.

NOTE: This goes well together with the sitegeist/treasuremap package that implements green/blue caching but can be used for other purposes as well.

### `./flow  scentmark:mark`
